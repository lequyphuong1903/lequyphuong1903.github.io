A new chapter begins! Iâ€™ve officially started my Masterâ€™s program in Industry 4.0 Convergence Bionics Engineering at Pukyong National University (PKNU).

Iâ€™m honored to join the NanoBioMechanics Laboratory (NBM Lab) under the supervision of Professor Junghwan Oh. This marks the start of an exciting journey in research, innovation, and continuous learning.
