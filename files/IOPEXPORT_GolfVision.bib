journal = {Measurement Science and Technology},
abstract = {This study introduces a real-time golf swing measurement system that captures the moment of impact between the clubface and the ball using a high-speed vision and customized YOLO-based segmentation model with enhanced performance. Unlike traditional radar-based systems, the proposed method directly measures the impact position and quantifies the deviation from the sweet spot along both horizontal and vertical axes. This approach allows for evaluating how the swing impact position influences key swing performance outcomes, including carry distance and ball speed. By eliminating the need for embedded sensors or radar infrastructure, the system can acquire cost-efficiency while maintaining reliable detection performance. It is validated through comparative evaluation between beginner and professional golfers, revealing distinct impact characteristics appropriate to their skill levels. A real-time feedback interface provides intuitive visualization for users, enhancing training effectiveness. The customized deep neural network achieved an average F1 score of 94.3% in detecting impact position, and this level demonstrates that the customized model works well even with the fast movements during golf swing. As the demand for accessible golf performance measurement grows, this vision-based system allows amateur golf players to receive immediate and interpretable feedback for swing correction without reliance on expensive commercial devices. The proposed method offers a scalable solution for personalized coaching and keeps potential for extensive application in the golf-specific AI analytics.}
